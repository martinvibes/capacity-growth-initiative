# TODO List for Making Landing Page Full Height and Cross-Browser Compatible

- [x] Update the main container in `src/app/page.tsx` to use `min-h-screen` for full viewport height.
- [x] Ensure sections stack vertically and handle overflow properly.
- [x] Verify responsive design in globals.css and components.
- [x] Test the page in different browsers and screen sizes.
- [x] Fix marque positioning to stay at the bottom in Microsoft Edge.
