# TODO List for Making Landing Page Full Height and Cross-Browser Compatible

- [x] Update the main container in `src/app/page.tsx` to use `min-h-screen` for full viewport height.
- [x] Ensure sections stack vertically and handle overflow properly.
- [x] Verify responsive design in globals.css and components.
- [x] Test the page in different browsers and screen sizes.
- [x] Fix marque positioning to stay at the bottom in Microsoft Edge.
- [x] Added `relative` class to the hero section in `page.tsx` for proper positioning context.
- [x] Added `w-full` class to the marque container in `Marque.tsx` to ensure full width.
- [x] Updated `.marquee-container` in `globals.css` to use `position: absolute` and explicit positioning for cross-browser compatibility.
